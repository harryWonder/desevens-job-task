### LARAVEL & VUEJS Fullstack Application

This lesson covers how to build a Full-stack application using Laravel & Vuejs. The requirements are pretty much very simple once you follow the list I have laid out below.

This is like you usual laravel application. The only difference is that you will have to install some javascript dependencies this time.

### Steps

1. Fork or clone this project. Whichever works for you.
2. Open the project directory in your terminal or command prompt and enter the commands below.

   `composer install`
   `npm install`
   `php artisan passport:install`
   `npm run watch`

3. After this you have to open a seperate terminal window and run **Laravel's favourite artisan command**. `php artisan serve.`

4. Read up the blog on [Learning Dollars](https://blog.learningdollars.com/?p=7737&preview=true) to learn how to deploy this to heroku.

Thanks for reading. Happy hacking guys!
